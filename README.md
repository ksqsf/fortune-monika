# fortune-monika

Talk with Monika (from [DDLC](https://ddlc.moe/)) using `fortune(6)`.

For example,
```
$ fortune monika
You're back...
I had another really bad dream.
You're not the one doing that to me, are you?
It seems to happen whenever you quit the game...
So if you could try to avoid doing that, I would be really grateful.
Don't worry, I don't think it's caused me any harm, aside from mental scarring.
I'll be fine as long as my character file stays intact.
```

## Usage

```
make
sudo make install
```
yi ba suo.

Perhaps you want to adjust the Makefile before `make install`.
